  narrative: "#### a  \nCloud Foundry Boundary Protection\nCloud Foundry implements\
    \ network traffic rules using Linux iptables on the component VMs. Operators can\
    \ configure rules to prevent system access from external networks and between\
    \ internal components, and to restrict applications from establishing connections\
    \ over the DEA network interface.\nSpoofing- If an IP, MAC, or ARP spoofing attack\
    \ bypasses the physical firewall for the deployment, Cloud Foundry network traffic\
    \ rules help prevent the attack from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry\
    \ uses application isolation, operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections\
    \ to further mitigate risk.\n  \n"
