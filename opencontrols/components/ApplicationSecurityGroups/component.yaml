  narrative: 'Cloud.Gov uses application security groups act as virtual firewalls
    to control outbound traffic from the applications in deployment. Cloud.Gov evaluates
    security groups and other network traffic rules in a strict priority order. Cloud
    Foundry returns and allow, deny, or reject result for the first rule that matches
    the outbound traffic request parameters, and does not evaluate any lower-priority
    rules. Cloud Foundry evaluates the network traffic rules for an application in
    the following order:

    Security Groups: The rules described by the Default Staging set, the Default Running
    set, and all security groups bound to the space.

    Cloud.Gov implements network traffic rules using Linux iptables on the component
    VMs. DevOps configures rules to prevent system access from external networks and
    between internal components, and to restrict applications from establishing connections
    over the DEA network interface. Cloud.Gov application security groups (ASG) consists
    of a list of access rules to control application outbound traffic.

    DEA Network Properties allow DevOps to configure the allow_networks and deny_networks
    parameters for DEAs to prohibit communication between system components and applications.

  narrative: '18F has created specific Cloud.Gov security groups associated with VPCs
    to provide full control over inbound and outbound traffic. 18F has created a specific
    set of VPCs (Live production and staging) for its Cloud.Gov implementation.  All
    VPCs have subnets used to separate and control IP address space within each individual
    VPC.  Subnets must be created in order to launch Availability Zone (AZ) specific
    services within a VPC. 18F has setup VPC Peering between the Staging VPC and the
