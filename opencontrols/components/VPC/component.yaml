  narrative: 'The virtual private cloud logically separates the hosted services from other information systems within its environment. Any service built using AWS VPC will reside within its
    own virtual private network and may have its own dedicated elastic load balancers for incoming traffic.

  narrative: "#### a  \nAWS Boundary Protection - Secure Network Architecture\n18F\
    \ utilizes the AWS provided virtual network devices, including firewall and other\
    \ boundary devices, in place to monitor and control communications at the external\
    \ boundary of the network and at key internal boundaries within the network. These\
    \ boundary devices employ rule sets, access control lists (ACL), and configurations\
    \ to enforce the flow of information to specific information system services.\n\
    ACLs, or traffic flow policies, are established on each managed interface, which\
    \ manage and enforce the flow of traffic.\n Designated privileged users(PU) connects to\
    \ an AWS access point via HTTP or HTTPS using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a cryptographic protocol\
    \ that is designed to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.\n\
    PU utilizes the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which provides a private subnet\
    \ within the AWS cloud. Each VPC is configured to utilize Routing Rules, Subnet\
    \ Rules, and Security Group Rules.  Each of these controls must have appropriate\
    \ rules and routes in-place before any external service is able to reach a host\
    \ within AWS.\n  \n#### b  \nEach VPC is configured to utilize Routing Tables,\
    \ and Security Groups.  Each of these controls must have appropriate rules and\
    \ routes in-place before any external service is able to reach the host within the \
    \ information system boundry.\n  \n#### c  \nThe information system is internal to the defined\
    \ VPC and does not connect to external networks or information\
    \ systems outside the VPC.\n  \n"

  narrative: "Since the infromation system platform resides within the defined virtual infrastructure,\
    \ Privileged User (PU) must use SSH remote access method to troubleshoot issues and\
    \ update services that are only resolved by logging into a Bastion Host (BH).\
    \ The BH themselves are virtual machine deployed within the organization's\
    \ virtual private cloud. They are the only access points for designated PU\
    \ members to run privileged commnds that affect the entire platform. No other\
    \ privileged remote access is available to the information system.\n"

  narrative: "The organization incorporates security features within its vpc such as IAM security\
    \ groups, network ACLs, routing tables, and external gateways. Each of these items\
    \ is complementary to providing a secure, isolated network.\nNetwork Access control\
    \ lists (ACLs) are created to allow or deny traffic entering or exiting these\
    \ subnets. Each subnet has routing tables attached to them to direct the flow\
    \ of network traffic to Internet gateways, virtual private gateways, Network Address\
    \ Translation (NAT) for private subnets.\nThe organization's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure\
    \ has firewalls enabling filtering on both ingress and egress traffic from its\
    \ instances. The default group enables inbound communication from other members\
    \ of the same group and outbound communication to any destination.\nTraffic is\
    \ restricted by IP protocol, by service port, as well as source/destination IP\
    \ address (individual IP or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block).\n"
