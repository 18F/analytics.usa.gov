        Agency System Maintenance Policy Implementation

        System Maintenance Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT Security Policy, Chapter 4. Policy on Operational Controls.
        It states, "The availability and usability of GSA equipment and software must be maintained and safeguarded to enable agency
        objectives to be accomplished."

        GSA OCISO ISP also defined agency-wide system maintenance procedures in IT Security Procedural Guide:
        Maintenance (CIO-IT Security-10-50)

        18F follows the GSA System Maintenance policy for its information systems hosted within GSA facilities. The Cloud.Gov information
        system is hosted with the AWS GovCloud and will be in purview of the hosting siteâ€™s Maintenance policy and procedures
