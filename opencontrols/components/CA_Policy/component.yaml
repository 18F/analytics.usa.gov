      The 18F Program develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including:

      * Security controls and control enhancements under assessment
      * Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness
      * Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities

      cloud.gov is designed for compliance with the Federal Risk and Authroization Management Plan and has adopted the FedRAMP Assessment and Authorization program as the basis for its Security and Priavacy compliance activities. cloud.gov engages a FedRAMP Accredited Third Pary Assessment Organzation (3PAO) to develop a compliant security assessment plan.

      18F has developed a plan of action and milestones (POA&M) for the information system which documents the remediation actions to correct weaknesses found or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities.

      The majority of vulnerabilities are found during continuous monitoring activities including monthly vulnerability scanning, updates to cloud.gov systems components, static code analysis on applications and infrastucture and system monitoring tools. The 18F ISSOs are tasked with developing plans of actions and milestones for valid findings and vulnerabilities. The devops administrators are tasked to mitigate high findings within 30 days, moderate findings within 60 days and low findings within 120 days.

      External Penetration testing

      External penetration testing activities are conducted by GSA OCISO on an annual basis. These activites are designed to perform the necessary vulnerability analysis against cloud.gov based on all necessary security requirements. The GSA OCISO follows the GSA CIO IT Security Procedural Guide, CIO-IT Security-11-51, Conducting Penetration Test Exercises when performing these tests.

      18F must request permission from AWS using the AWS Vulnerability / Penetration Testing Request Form to conduct penetration test activities against its own Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure and follow the AWS Acceptable Use Policy.
      Amazon requires customers to obtain authorization for penetration testing (or vulnerability assessments) both from or to their AWS resources.

      AWS Acceptable Use Policy, http://aws.amazon.com/aup/
      AWS Penetration testing,  http://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/

      GSA ISE performs penetration testing services for the GSA information systems hosted on the cloud.gov platform. It is also bound by the AWS penetration testing policy and procedures when conducting its penetration tests.

      Internal Penetration testing

      For internal penetration testing inside 18F's Virtual Private Cloud, 18F team members will conduct whitebox/greybox testing of the 18F environment using approved assessment tools.

      For compliance with NIST Publication 800-53 CA-8, Parameter 1 Penetration Testing of all 18F Infrastructure and Application Components will occur annually. Parameter 2 Penetration Testing of Publicly Accessible Infrastructure will be performed on the direction of the 18F .
