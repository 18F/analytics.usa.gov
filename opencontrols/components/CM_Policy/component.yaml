        Agency Configuration Management Policy

        The GSA CM policy is defined in the GSA IT Security Policy (CIO P 2100.1), which addresses purpose, scope, roles,
        responsibilities, and compliance for CM activities.

        The GSA Office of the CISO is responsible for publishing the above documents to System Program Managers and Information
        System Security Officers and Managers (ISSO/Ms) on a centralized, agency-accessible website.

        CM procedures are documented in the GSA IT Security Procedural Guide: Managing Enterprise Risks (CIO IT Security-06-30).

        The 18F Program Office develops, documents, and disseminates to all 18F staff

        The 18F configuration management policy which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
        coordination among organizational entities, and compliance and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
        configuration management policy and associated configuration controls. The 18F security assessment and authorization
        policy is listed within its private GitHub repository https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/CM-Policy.md
        that is accessible to all 18F staff.

        For AWS Baseline Configurations:

        AWS Cloud Formation templates, CIS Level 1 benchmarks and any GSA/18F benchmarks such as hardening guidelines
        and baselines are the approved baseline for all changes to the infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management
        on AWS. They provide an automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against an approved
        baseline.

        Windows and Linux instances are based on the standard AWS AMI images in accordance with GSA configuration requirements.

        For cloud.gov Baseline Configurations:

        cloud.gov utilizes customized Ubuntu stemcells and deployment manifest yaml files for its baseline configurations.
        The list of the configuration settings can be found at the following site https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos/

        A stemcell is a versioned Operating System image wrapped with IaaS specific packaging. A typical stemcell contains
        a bare minimum OS skeleton with a few common utilities pre-installed, a BOSH Agent, and a few configuration files
        to securely configure the OS by default. With AWS, official stemcells are published as AMIs that can be used in the
        18F AWS account. Stemcells do not contain any specific information about any software that will be installed once
        that stemcell becomes a specialized machine in the cluster; nor do they contain any sensitive information which
        would make them unable to be shared with other BOSH users.  The deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines
        the components and properties of the deployment.

        Note: Additional OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance may also be used whenever appropriate. It is
        understood that when industry standards are adopted they may need to be adapted for the specific implementation
        and if/where this has occurred it should be mentioned/referenced. 18F ensures that the most current, relevant
        OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance is maintained where appropriate to support cloud.gov configurations.
        These best practice updates are captured during the annual review of the CM Policy which also incorporates 18 procedures.

        The 18F PMO reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system when required by the FedRAMP JAB
        board. Significant change may result from, but are not limited to, multiple required changes occurring simultaneously,
        changes that impact/modify security settings, and/or major component additions and/or upgrades. Such changes will go
        through the 18F CM Process, presented to the FedRAMP assigned ISSO and if applicable, be submitted to the JAB for
        review, vetting acceptability and to ensure ongoing acceptance of security control implementation(s).

        Configuration management at the AWS level is managed through CloudFormation automation templates, AWS Config and
        VisualOps. 18F maintains baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates
        help maintains a strict configuration management scheme of the cloud.gov. Because these templates are text files, 18F
        can simply track differences in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure.

        For cloud.gov, an operator initiates a new deployment using the BOSH CLI, the BOSH Director receives a version of the
        deployment manifest and creates a new deployment using this manifest. Automated Configuration of cloud.gov platform
        components is handled by the Concourse.ci, a continuous integration and deployment tool which utilizes the cloud.gov
        customized Ubuntu stemcells and deployment manifest yaml files for its baseline configurations.

        All Configuration Change control:
        18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation
        template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
        Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
        these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way
        developers control revisions to source code.

        18F uses version control systems with its cloud formation templates to know
        exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F
        needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of
        a template.

        18F uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes
        within the infrastructure and applications including Cloud Foundry platform as
        a service. Within GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast any
        changes made to configurations of Cloud Foundry.

        virtual infrastructure, 18F uses VisualOps and Cloud Checkr for real-time
        configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.
        All Cloud Foundry configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked
        within 18F's GitHub site.  All configuration changes related to applications
        and websites hosted within the 18F AWS and Cloud Foundry environment are

        18F posts its current inventory of information systems on its dashboard
        located at  https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/. Several sources are used to capture
        complete inventories of the virtual infrastructure and its information systems
        while providing the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.
        The AWS Management Console, VisualOps, Cloud Checkr, Github, and Nexpose are used
        to provide additional enumeration capabilities.

        Cloud Checkr is currently deployed to facilitate asset management, along with
        other operations activities, on a real-time ongoing basis. Components deployed
        in the virtual infrastructure are accurately inventoried and can be filtered to
        a specific informaton system groups as well as a group of web services or  those
        components that are related to a spcecific informaton system.

        The VisualOps Cloud management tool is used to provide a visual, real-time and
        automated representation of the virtual infrastructure and applications within
        the 18F environment. It also provides a global view of the 18F AWS account where
        all regions and services can be seen in one place.

        The 18F GitHub repository also is used to show a current lists of components
        that make up the cloud.gov inventory. It is located at https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos/

        Nexpose maintains an inventory of all assets scanned within the 18F virtual Private
        Cloud. This includes all information system within the VPCs and components within
        the cloud.gov platform as a service.

        Bosh continuously maintains inventory of all instances and configuration

        cloud.gov operators review and update the information system component inventory
        on a monthly basis and updates the inventory of information system whenever installations,
        removals, and other changes are made. 18F will verify that all components within
        the authorized boundary of the information system are either inventoried as part
        of the system or recognized by another system as a component within that systems
        inventory.
