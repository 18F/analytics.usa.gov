      System and Communications Protection Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT Security Policy, Chapter 5. Policy on Technical Controls.  It states, "All network devices that are either owned, managed, maintain a connection to a GSA facility, and/or handle GSA data shall be strategically positioned behind a GSA firewall to provide analysis/correlation, management structure, and minimize threats presented by external attacks.

      The 18F program includes a library of security policies that address federal and non-federal requirements. These policies guide and govern the actions of 18F employees and contractors in conducting any United States business.

      The 18F security assessment, communications, and authorization policy is listed within its GitHub repository that is accessible to all 18F staff.

      18F helps develop, document, and disseminate policy information to 18F staff members.

      This 18F policy contains a protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

      18F's "Before You Ship" guide facilitates the implementation of the system and communications protection policy and associated system and communications protection controls.

      See https://github.com/18F/before-you-ship/ for more information.

      18F implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks. System management functionality to cloud.gov infrastructure is hosted on AWS FedRAMP Certificated Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and is accessible only to 18F Administrative teams through AWS IAM specified roles. This is a Service Provider and Customer Responsibility.

      cloud.gov system architecture prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. cloud.gov uses Cloud Foundry components to protect users and shared resources from security threats by minimizing network surface area, applying security controls, isolating customer applications and data in containers, and encrypting connections.

      Refer to the 18F policy statement for the types of denial of service (DoS) to protect our systems against. Policy https://github.com/18f/compliance-docs/blob/master/SC-Policy.md

      cloud.gov limits the effects of Volume Based and Protocol DoS type attacks by utilizing the following groups of technical measures:

      18F administrative staff maintains hardened Amazon Managed Images (AMI) and Cloud Foundry custom buildpacks with the latest patches and updates.

      Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for applications that are deployed on cloud.gov.  The AMI and custom buildpacks are maintained and secured within 18F's software repository, GitHub.

      cloud.gov also uses AWS's IaaS services with well-formed Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rules to reduce the attack surface, while service resiliency is maintained by utilizing AWS Availability Zones, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling services.

      Cloud Foundry's security components limit the effects of an attack at the Application Layer. It limits DoS attacks on this layer through resource starvation and reduction of the attack surface even further with well-formed application security groups which control the traffic flowing from hosted applications.

      These tools combined with SOC staffing are responsible for maintaining system security.

      cloud.gov protects the availability of resources by allocating
      volatile and non-volatile storage, bandwidth, and availability by using automated
      AWS features such as Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling technology at the
      infrastructure layer and Cloud Foundry's application lifecycle manager components,
      Cloud Controller and Droplet Execution Agent (DEA), at the application layers.

      18F safeguards are in place if resources are reaching their limits with multiple sets of
      resource monitoring tools:  Cloud Foundry's built-in health monitoring system, New Relic,
      CloudWatch, and ELK, which combined provide real-time alerts and visibility into critical

      Host-based boundary protection for application services hosted on cloud.gov are provided by CF components.

      Cloud Foundry Application Security Groups (ASGs) control the traffic flowing out of applications. Each CF application uses a dedicated Linux container, and each container includes a dedicated virtual network interface. Application security groups are a collection of ‘allow’ rules that can be made with global or application specific assignments enabling access to be set on individual application requirements. These requirements are added through whitelisting, and whitelisting is layered on top of a series of container-centric lock-downs, allowing limited access to other applications and services.
