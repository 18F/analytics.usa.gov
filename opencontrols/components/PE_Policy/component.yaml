        Agency Physical and Environmental Policy
        Physical and Environmental Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT Security Policy, Chapter 4. Policy on Operational Controls.  
        It states, "Physical and environmental security controls must be commensurate with the level of risk and must be sufficient to safeguard IT resources against possible loss, theft, destruction, accidental damage, hazardous conditions, fire, malicious actions, and natural disasters."
        GSA OCISO ISP also defined agency-wide access control procedures in IT Security Procedural Guide: Access Control (CIO-IT Security-01-07)
