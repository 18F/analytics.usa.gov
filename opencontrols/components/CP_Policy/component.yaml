        Agency Contingency planning policy

        Contingency Planning policies and procedures is a common control provided by GSA Information Security Policy
        and Compliance Division (ISP) of the OCISO. Contingency Planning Policy is included in CIO P 2100.1 - GSA IT
        Security Policy, Chapter 4. Policy on Operational Controls.  It states, "Contingency planning focuses on the
        recovery and restoration of an IT system following a disruption. The contingency plan supports the agency Continuity of
        Operations Plan (COOP) required by HSPD-20, “National Continuity Policy,” ensuring that Primary Mission-Essential
        Functions continue to be performed during a wide range of emergencies. Contingency and continuity of support plans
        must be developed and tested annually for all IT systems in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-130, NIST SP 800-34,
        “Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems"

        GSA OCISO ISP also defined agency-wide contingency planning procedures in IT Security Procedural Guide: Contingency
        Planning (CIO-IT Security-06-29)

        The 18F Program Office develops, documents, and disseminates to all 18F staff
        The 18F configuration management policy which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
        coordination among organizational entities, and compliance and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
        Contingency Planning policy and associated controls. The 18F Contingency Planning policy is listed within its private
        GitHub repository https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/CP-Policy.md that is accessible to all 18F staff.

        The GSA Office of the CISO is responsible for reviewing and updating the above documents annually, and notifying System
        Program Managers and Information System Security Officers and Managers (ISSO/Ms).

        The 18F Program Office will review and update the current 18F Contingency Planning policy at least every 3 years and
        any documented configuration procedures at least annually.

        cloud.gov will leverage the AWS IaaS for its Alternate storage site capabilities. This implementation employs the use of
        multiple Availability Zones within one AWS Region, which constitute a built-in alternate storage site capability for data
        stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS databases.  S3 uses multiple availability zones by default, and RDS databases deployed
        by this package are replicated across multiple availability zones.
