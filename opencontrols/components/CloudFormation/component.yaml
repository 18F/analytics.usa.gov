  narrative: 'DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances
    and AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration
    management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration
    of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs)
    is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates;
    compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and
    approved state.

    AWS Cloud Formation templates are the approved baseline for all changes to the
    infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management on AWS. They provide an
    automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against
    an approved baseline.

    Linux instances are based on the standard AWS AMI images with configuration to
    GSA requirements based on secure configurations documented in CM-6.

    DevOps maintain copies of the latest Production Software Baseline, which includes
    the following elements: Manufacturer, Type, Version number, Software, Databases,
    and Stats.

  narrative: '- 18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS
    CloudFormation template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their
    settings. Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences
    in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way
    developers control revisions to source code.

    - 18F uses several version control systems(i.e. AWS Config, AWS Service Catalog)
    with its templates to know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and
    when. If at any point 18F needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can
    use a previous version of a template.
