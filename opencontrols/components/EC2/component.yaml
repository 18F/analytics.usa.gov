  narrative: "#### a  \nThe AWS network provides significant protection against traditional\
    \ network security issues, and 18F can implement further protection. The following\
    \ are a few examples:\nDistributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) Attacks. AWS API endpoints\
    \ are hosted on large, Internet-scale, infrastructure. Proprietary DDoS mitigation\
    \ techniques are used. Additionally, AWS\u2019s networks are multi-homed across\
    \ a number of providers to achieve Internet access diversity.\nMan in the Middle\
    \ (MITM) Attacks. All of the AWS APIs are available via SSL-protected endpoints\
    \ which provide server authentication. Amazon EC2 AMIs automatically generate\
    \ new SSH host certificates on first boot and log them to the instance\u2019s\
    \ console. 18F can then use the secure APIs to call the console and access the\
    \ host certificates before logging into the instance for the first time. 18F uses\
    \ SSL for all interactions with AWS.\nIP Spoofing. Amazon EC2 instances cannot\
    \ send spoofed network traffic. The AWS-controlled, host-based firewall infrastructure\
    \ will not permit an instance to send traffic with a source IP or MAC address\
    \ other than its own.\n\nAmazon EC2 provides a complete firewall solution; this\
    \ mandatory inbound firewall is configured in a default deny-all mode and Amazon\
    \ EC2 customers must explicitly open the ports needed to allow inbound traffic.\
    \ The traffic may be restricted by protocol, by service port, as well as by source\
    \ IP address (individual IP or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block).\n\
    The firewall is configured in groups permitting different groups of instances\
    \ to have different rules.\n  \n"
