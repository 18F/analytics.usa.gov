      cloud.gov forces https using SecureProxy:

      Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured
      for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud
      Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic. The default cf-release manifest
      assigns port 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications.

      All traffic from the public internet to the Cloud Controller and UAA happens over
      HTTPS. Inside the boundary of the system, components communicate over publish-subscribe
      (pub-sub) message bus, NATs on port 4222.

      To combat spoofing Cloud Foundry network traffic rules help prevent the attack
      from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry uses application isolation,
      operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further mitigate risk.

      Application developers push their code using the Cloud Foundry API. Cloud Foundry
      secures each call to the CF API using the UAA and SSL
