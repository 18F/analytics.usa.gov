  narrative: "18F utilizes the Cloud Foundry Secure Deployment best practices which\
    \ include the following:\nConfigure UAA clients and users using a standard BOSH\
    \ manifest for cloud Foundry Deployment. Limit and manage these clients and users\
    \ as you would any other kind of privileged account.\nDeploy within a VPC that\
    \ limits network traffic to individual VMs. This reduces the possibility of unauthorized\
    \ access to the VMs within your BOSH-managed cloud.\nEnable HTTPS for applications\
    \ and SSL database connections to protect sensitive data transmitted to and from\
    \ applications.\nEnsure that the jumpbox is secure, along with the load balancer\
    \ and NAT VM.\nEncrypt stored files and data within databases to meet data security\
    \ requirements. Deploy using industry standard encryption and the best practices\
    \ for your language or framework.\nProhibit promiscuous network interfaces on\
    \ the trusted network.\nReview and monitor data sharing and security practices\
    \ with third-party services that you use to provide additional functionality to\
    \ your application.\nStore SSH keys securely to prevent disclosure, and promptly\
    \ replace lost or compromised keys.\nUse Cloud Foundry\u2019s RBAC model to restrict\
    \ users\u2019 access to only what is necessary to complete their tasks.\nUse a\
    \ strong passphrase for both Cloud Foundry user account and SSH keys.\n\nStore\
    \ SSH keys securely to prevent disclosure, and promptly replace lost or compromised\
    \ keys.\nUse Cloud Foundry\u2019s RBAC model to restrict users\u2019 access to\
    \ only what is necessary to complete their tasks.\nUse a strong passphrase for\

  narrative: 'All 18F DevOps user input happens at the BOSH command line interface
    (CLI) which requires specific syntax and parameters to be used in order to execute
    job functions. Rules for checking the valid syntax of information system inputs
    (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place
    to verify that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs
    passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally
    interpreted as commands. The extent to which the information system is able to
    check the accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of information is
    guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.

    The data inputs as part of the Cloud Foundry are validated in several ways. The
    validation is a series of steps put in place to ensure consistent data and to
    protect the system from corruption, either malicious or accidental. The data validation
    takes place in the same mechanism either through the web user interface (where
    data validation errors are shown to the authenticated user to correct) or programmatically
    through web service APIs. (where error messages are returned showing where data
    is rejected).
