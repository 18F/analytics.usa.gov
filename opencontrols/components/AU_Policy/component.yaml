        Audit logs will be made available to organizations for mutual support in
        response to security breaches, system and user access, incident reporting and
        continuous monitoring. 18F will generate and distribute audit reports, provide
        customized dashboard access for audited events, and send audit log data to SIEM
        and log analysis systems from its audit logging and metrics tools for the
        cloud.gov platform and virtual infrastructure as needed.

        18F retains audit logs according to NARA retention standards to provide support
        for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory
        and organizational information retention requirements. The log management
        framework will provide the capability to retain logs for 90 days online and
        one-year offline, with sufficient capacity as to mitigate the risk of exceeding
        storage space.

        Specific Policies, Procedures, Points of Contact, and Guidance will be established
        between 18F and other agencies to support after-the-fact investigations, by the
        18F Project Lead.

        The Cloud.Gov information system generates audit records containing the following additional information:
        session, connection, transaction, or activity duration; for client-server transactions, the number of bytes received
        and bytes sent; additional informational messages to diagnose or identify the event; characteristics that describe or
        identify the object or resource being acted upon.

        Cloudtrail can generate a subset of audit records containing additional information within the AWS infrastructure.

        - Security Groups, Security Group Rules, Key Pairs, AMIs, Spot Instances, Reserved Instance, Instances, Volumes,

        cloud.gov audit logs are stored within the elasticsearch component of
        the ELK stack which is clusterd for redundancy and failover functions. This solutions
        provide the capability to extend the audit storage capacity without the likelihood
        of the capacity being exceeded. 18F plans to incorporate the use of the S3 cloud
        service for greater storage capacity if needed.

        AWS Auditable Events:
        DevOps and SecOps teams will conduct weekly manual and automated continuous
        audits of authorized accounts and configurations. These audits will include
        but are not limited to:

        Administrative Accounts

        * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
        * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
        * Simple Storage Service (S3)
        * Identity and Access Management (IAM)
        * Elastic Block Store (EBS)

        Cloud Foundry Auditable Events:
        By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs to
        a third-party log management service such as ELK and AWS CloudTrail Cloud
        Foundry logs are captured in multiple tables and log files. These will be
        reviewed weekly and if discovery of anomalous audit log content which appears
        to indicate a breach are handled according to the GSA Security Incident
        Handling Guide: CIO IT Security 01-02 Revision 7 (August 18, 2009) requirements.

        When a credible source to the GSA Agency provides information that causes

        use-case that will adequately enhance auditing practices in a fashion necessary
        per the identified threat and following the Incident Reporting Procedures in
        GSA IT Security Procedural Guide 01-02 (04/07/2015), Incident Response. The GSA
        Agency may also, through analysis pertaining to the GSA Agency environment
        provide additional audit measures that will require an increase in review,

        Upon implementation, 18F will monitor information security news and alerts for
        indications of a need to heighten information system security monitoring.

        Audit Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting

        * 18F establishes processes for regularly reviewing audit log information, and
        reporting security issues if discovered. Reviews will occur at a minimum of
        weekly. These processes should be integrated with processes for incident
        response, in order to ensure standardization and cross-functional collaboration
        * 18F employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit monitoring, analysis and
        reporting into an overall process for investigation and response to suspicious
        activities.
        * 18F employs automated mechanisms to immediately alert security personnel of
        inappropriate or unusual activities that have security implications.

        The ELK Stack logging and monitoring system provides additional audit
        reduction and report generation capabilities for 18F DevOps and end users of the
        cloud.gov platform. With the elasticsearch capability 18F DevOps and SecOps teams
        can structure and customize audit logs queries to specific app instances, API
        calls, system metrics, user access, system components, network traffic flow and
        other functions. Kibana is used to generate customized dashboards and Logstash
        to generate reports for analysis and review.
