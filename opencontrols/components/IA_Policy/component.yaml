      The 18F Identification and Authentication Policy section 3 Identifier Management states:
      Identifier Management:
      18F manages information system identifiers for users and devices by:
      * Receiving authorization from a designated organizational official to assign a user or device identifier.
      * Selecting an identifier that uniquely identifies an individual or device.
      * Assigning the user identifier to the intended party or the device identifier to the intended device.
      * Preventing reuse of user or device identifiers for one (1).
      * Disabling the user identifier after ninety (90) days of inactivity for general user accounts and thirty (30) days for administrator level accounts.
