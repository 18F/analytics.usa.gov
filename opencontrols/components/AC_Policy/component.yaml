      The 18F Program Office develops, documents, and disseminates
      to all 18F staff the 18F Access Control Policy which addresses purpose, scope,
      roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
      entities, compliance, and procedures to facilitate the implementation of
      the access control policy and associated access controls. The 18F Access Control
      Policy is listed within 18F’s private Github repository and the docs.cloud.gov
      site that is accessible to all 18F staff.

      The 18F Program identifies and selects the following types of
      information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions:

    text: |
      18F has established designated DevOps personnel as the assigned
      account managers for all information system accounts relating to the infrastructure
      and the cloud.gov platform.
      System Owners, whose web applications and/or websites
      reside on the cloud.gov platform, have the responsibility to assign an account
      manager for their information systems.
  - key: c
    text: |
      18F establishes conditions
      for group and role membership within the cloud.gov platform and its virtual
      environment.
      Conditions for groups and roles membership are based on an established
      need to manage and access the virtual infrastructure and cloud.gov environments.
      The user must meet the following conditions in order for the System Owner / Project
      Manager to approve a group membership request:
        * The user’s assigned role is required to access a particular group.
        * The user has the requirements and understanding to assume permissions associated with the group.
        * The user has completed the security role-based training.
        * The user complies with any other group-specific conditions created by the system owner.
      Once conditions have been met, the System Owner / Project Manager will request access within
      GitHub, 18F’s tracking and ticketing system. Once approved, the 18F DevOps group
      completes the request for group and role membership within its infrastructure
      and cloud.gov platform.
  - key: d
    text: |
      The 18F Program Office specifies authorized
      users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations
      (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account. System
      Owners / Project Managers provide the details of what type of access is needed
      for an authorized authorized user.
      All accounts will be documented within their
      respective information systems, detailing their group and role membership, and
      access authorizations. This documentation will be exported by DevOps and archived
      for up to a year from the date of account creation by the managing 18F project
      lead and cloud.gov Technical Point of Contact (Operating Environment) in accordance
      with best business and security practices.
  - key: e

      18F requires approvals by the project lead and system owners for requests to create information system
      accounts. All accounts will be documented within the GitHub ticketing and tracking
      system with their respective information systems, detailing their group, role
      membership, and access authorizations.

      with 18F policies, guidelines and established by the project lead and DevOps.

      18F monitors the use of all information system accounts within
      its environment.
  - key: h

      18F notifies its DevOps account managers when accounts are no longer required, users are terminated or transferred, and when
      individual’s information system usage or need-to-know changes within the cloud.gov
      platform and virtual private cloud infrastructure.
      The Project Manager or Information
      System Owner will be notified when accounts have been terminated, disabled or
      transferred based on the access request submitted via GitHub.  Notification
      will be sent via email or the GitHub ticketing and tracking system when changes
      to user and system access occur.

      18F authorizes access to its
      information systems based on a valid access authorization from System Owners
      and DevOps, intended system usage within the network environment, and other
      attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions.
      This is documented within section 3 of the 18F Access Control Policy: Access
      Management.
      User and system access is provided only to those with an established
      need to access and manage the virtual private cloud and cloud.gov environments.
      * User group membership is restricted to the least privilege necessary for the user to accomplish their assigned duties.
      * All user accounts are issued only to those who have gained approval by 18F DevOps.
      Once approved, the DevOps team creates the user account and adds it to the appropriate role and organization
      within its information systems.
      18F grants access to the information system
      based on:
        * A valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria.
        * Intended system usage.
      18F requires proper identification for requests to establish information
      system accounts, and it approves all such requests based on organizational or mission/business
      function attributes.

      18F reviews user and system accounts for compliance with account management requirements at least on an annual basis.
      \ Currently, system and user accounts are being monitored manually on a monthly
      basis and programmatically on a continuous basis.

      18F establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials when individuals are
      removed from the group. 18F uses its GitHub tracking and ticketing system
      for requests to reissue and remove individuals from group memberships within
      its environment.

        * 18F must provide access enforcement through the use of access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system.

      encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish
      configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a
      packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering

      IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions

      policies, 18F only grants users within its own AWS account permission to access
      its Amazon resources.
      18F AWS IAM policies are defined to grant only the required access for 18F staff
      necessary to perform their functions. 18F defines least privilege access to each user,
      group, or role.
      Security functions within the AWS infrastructure are explicitly defined within IAM to

      The cloud.gov platform has built-in role based access controls (RBAC). This

      granted access to. It also prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged
      functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security
      safeguards/countermeasures.
      Only designated Org Managers from the DevOps team can execute privileged functions
      to the cloud.gov platform. All other accounts are non-privileged accounts.
      Client agencies using cloud.gov are only permitted to change settings within their
      associated Org account, spaces and roles. These accounts do not have access to the
      underlying cloud.gov platform.
