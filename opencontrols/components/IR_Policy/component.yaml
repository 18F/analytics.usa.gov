      cloud.gov developed an Incident Response Guide documenting the procedures required by the 18F and GSA Incident Response Policy.
      The guide is disseminated to the whole cloud.gov team to ensure everyone is aware of its existence and contents.
      The incident response guide is publicly available at https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/security-ir/ and it is continually updated based on changes to the team and the platform.

      cloud.gov implements automated processes to detect and analyze malicious activity within the platform.
      If these processes detect malicious activity, they automatically report the activity to the cloud.gov operations team, which is able to use automated tools to eradicate the threat and recover to a known state.
      cloud.gov uses a service-oriented architecture that allows natural containment and separation.

      The cloud.gov team has developed both an Incident Response Guide and checklist to implement incident response capabilities.
      Given the small size of the cloud.gov team, the structure of the incident response process is clear and concise; it assigns the first responder to the event the role of Incident Commander.
      The Incident Response Guide provides clear guidance on what steps to take on each situation and how reporting should be handled.
      The Incident Response Guide empowers the Incident Commander to leverage as many resources from GSA and 18F as needed during the response process.
      The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team and approved annually by the Authorizing Official.

      The Incident Response Guide is stored in GitHub as a public open source file. The branch from which the document is generated is a protected branch forbidding the unauthorized deletion of revision history. Moreover, the cloud.gov team has both configured the repository and provided team policies to ensure strict controls on who has authority to approve changes to this guide.
