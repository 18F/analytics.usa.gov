# The analytics.usa.gov API

In addition to being published and available for download, the data generated for this site is also available via an API.

The URL for the API is `https://api.gsa.gov/systems/dap`, and it exposes 2 routes to query data:

- `reports/<report name>/data`
- `agencies/<agency name>/reports/<report name>/data`

## The Response

The response represents the rows in the `data` array in the JSON reports that can be downloaded, or the rows in the CSV files that can be downloaded. They are returned as an array of JSON objects. Here is an example of one such object:

```
{
  "id": 60716,
  "report_name": "today",
  "report_agency": "justice",
  "date_time": "2017-04-07T14:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "visits": "4240"
  },
  "created_at": "2017-04-07T04:23:55.792Z",
  "updated_at": "2017-04-07T04:23:55.792Z"
}
```

Note that is has the following properties:

- `id`: The primary key of the data point
- `report_name`: The name of the data point's report
- `report_agency`: The name of the data point's agency
- `date_time`: The data/time the data in the data point corresponds to
- `data`: The data associated with the data point. This may contain child properties such as visits, browser, screen size, and so on, depending on the report

## Query params

The following query params are supported to work with the data:

- `limit`: Limit the number of data points that are rendered. The default is 1000 and the max is 10,000
- `page`: Pages through the results. If the limit is set to `1000`, using `page=2` will render the 1001st through 2000th data point.
