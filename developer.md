# The analytics.usa.gov API

In addition to being published and available for download, the data generated for this site is also available via an API.

The URL for the API is `https://api.gsa.gov/systems/dap`, and it exposes 2 routes to query data:

- `/reports/<report name>/data`
- `/agencies/<agency name>/reports/<report name>/data`

## API Keys

To use the API, please register for [an API key](https://api.data.gov/signup/) and include it in your query in this fashion:

- `https://api.gsa.gov/systems/dap/reports/today/data?api_key=DEMO_KEY1`

## The Response

The response represents the rows in the `data` array in the JSON reports that can be downloaded, or the rows in the CSV files that can be downloaded. They are returned as an array of JSON objects. Here is an example of one such object:

```
{
  "id": 60716,
  "report_name": "today",
  "report_agency": "justice",
  "date_time": "2017-04-07T14:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "visits": "4240"
  },
  "created_at": "2017-04-07T04:23:55.792Z",
  "updated_at": "2017-04-07T04:23:55.792Z"
}
```

Note that is has the following properties:

- `id`: The primary key of the data point
- `report_name`: The name of the data point's report
- `report_agency`: The name of the data point's agency
- `date_time`: The data/time the data in the data point corresponds to
- `data`: The data associated with the data point. This may contain child properties such as visits, browser, screen size, and so on, depending on the report
