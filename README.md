[This blog post details their implementations and lessons learned](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/05/tips-for-adapting-analytics-usa-gov/).

### Setup using Docker

You need  [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and  [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

To build and run the app with docker-compose, run `docker-compose up -d` then you can access the app from `http://localhost:4000`, as the local filesystem is mounted on top of the docker container you can edit the files as you are developing locally.

To see the jekyll logs, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Setup using Ruby

Ths app uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build the site, and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) for CSS.

Install them all:

```bash
bundle install
```

[`analytics-reporter`](https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter) is the code that powers the analytics dashboard.
Please clone the `analytics-reporter` next to a local copy of this github repository.

### Adding Additional Agencies

0. Ensure that data is being collected for a specific agency's Google Analytics ID. Visit [18F's analytics-reporter](https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter) for more information. Save the url path for the data collection path.
0. Create a new html file in the `_agencies` directory. The name of the file will be the url path.
  ```bash
  touch _agencies/agencyx.html
  ```
0. Create a new html file in the `_data_pages` directory. Use the same name you used in step 2. This will be the data download page for this agency

  ```bash
  touch _data_pages/agencyx.html
  ```
0. Set the required data for for the new files. (Both files need this data.) example:

  ```yaml
  ---
  name: Agency X # Name of the page
  slug: agencyx # Same as the name of the html files. Used to generate data page links.
  layout: default # type of layout used. available layouts are in `_layouts`
  ---
  ```
0. Agency page: Below the data you just entered, include the page content you want. The `_agencies` page will use the `charts.html` partial and the `_data_pages` pages will use the `data_download.html` partial. example:

```yaml
{% include charts.html %}
```

### Developing locally

Run Jekyll with development settings:

```bash
make dev
```

(This runs `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --config=_config.yml,_development.yml`.)

### Developing with local data

The development settings assume data is available at `/fakedata`. You can change this in `_development.yml`.


### Developing with real live data from `analytics-reporter`

If also working off of local data, e.g. using `analytics-reporter`, you will need to make the data available over HTTP _and_ through CORS.

Various tools can do this. This project recommends using the Node module `serve`:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Generate data to a directory:

```
analytics --output [dir]
```

Then run `serve` from the output directory:

```bash
serve --cors
```

The data will be available at `http://localhost:3000` over CORS, with no path prefix. For example, device data will be at `http://localhost:3000/devices.json`.


### Deploying the app

To deploy to **analytics.usa.gov** after building the site with the details in `_config.yml`:

```bash
make deploy_production
```

To deploy to **analytics-staging.app.cloud.gov** after building the site with the details in `_config.yml` and `_staging.yml`:

```bash
make deploy_staging
```

### Deploying the app using Docker

_NOTE_: 18F does not use Docker in production!

If you are using Docker in production and you want to deploy just the static pages, you can build an nginx container with the static files built in, running the following command:

```bash
make docker-build-production PROD_IMAGE=yourvendor/your-image-name PROD_TAG=latest
```

The resulting image will be a standard nginx server image that you can safely push and deploy to your server.

### Building & Pushing Docker Images

This repo has git tags. The tag for Docker images built for this repo relate to these git tags. In the examples below, `<version` refers to the tag value of the current commit. When building a new version, be sure to increment the git tag appropriately.

When building images there are 2 images to build: `<version>` and `<version>-production`.

To build the images:

```shell
docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version> .
docker build -f ./Dockerfile.production -t 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version>-production .
```

To push the images:

```shell
docker push 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version>
docker push 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version>-production
```
