## Public analytics

A collaboration to publish government website analytics.

### Building the Stylesheets

* Install [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), Bourbon, and Neat:

```bash
gem install sass bourbon neat
```

* To watch the Sass source for changes and build the stylesheets automatically, run:

```bash
make watch
```

* To compile the Sass stylesheets once, run:

```bash
make clean all
```

### Deploying the app

To deploy this app to `analytics.usa.gov`, you will need authorized access to 18F's Amazon S3 bucket for the project.

If using `s3cmd`, the command to deploy the site with a **5 minute cache time** is:

```bash
s3cmd put --recursive -P --add-header="Cache-Control:max-age=300" *.html images js css s3://18f-dap/
```

This deploys `index.html`, and the relevant static assets, to the bucket. For now, it sets a cache time of 0, though we may increase this.

### Fixing links in the Top 20

Links pulled directly from Google Analytics are occasionally broken (this is most common in the Top 20 section). For now, we're hard coding the fix in the `index.js` file [here](https://github.com/GSA/analytics.usa.gov/blob/master/js/index.js#L6) in the format: `"broken link" : "working link",`.
