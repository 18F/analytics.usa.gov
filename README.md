## analytics.usa.gov

A project to publish website analytics for the US federal government.

For a detailed description of how the site works, read [18F's blog post on analytics.usa.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/19/how-we-built-analytics-usa-gov/).

[This blog post details their implementations and lessons learned](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/05/tips-for-adapting-analytics-usa-gov/).  


### Setup

Ths app uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build the site, and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) for CSS.

Install them all:

```bash
bundle install
```

[`analytics-reporter`](https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter) is the code that powers the analytics dashboard.
Please clone the `analytics-reporter` next to a local copy of this github repository.

### Adding Additional Agencies
0. Ensure that data is being collected for a specific agency's Google Analytics ID. Visit [18F's analytics-reporter](https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter) for more information. Save the url path for the data collection path.
0. Create a new html file in the `_agencies` directory. The name of the file will be the url path.

  ```bash
  touch _agencies/agencyx.html
  ```
0. Set the required data for for the new file. example:

  ```yaml
  ---
  name: Agency X # Name of the page
  data_url: https://analytics.usa.gov/data/agencyx # Data URL from step 1
  layout: agencies # type of layout used. available layouts are in `_layouts`
  ---
  ```


### Developing locally

Run Jekyll with development settings:

```bash
make dev
```

(This runs `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --config=_config.yml,_development.yml`.)

Sass can watch the .scss source files for changes, and build the .css files automatically:

```bash
make watch
```

To compile the Sass stylesheets once, run `make clean all`, or `make -B` to compile even if the .css file already exists.

### Developing with local data

The development settings assume data is available at `/fakedata`. You can change this in `_development.yml`.


### Developing with real live data from `analytics-reporter`

If also working off of local data, e.g. using `analytics-reporter`, you will need to make the data available over HTTP _and_ through CORS.

Various tools can do this. This project recommends using the Node module `serve`:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Generate data to a directory:

```
analytics --output [dir]
```

Then run `serve` from the output directory:

```bash
serve --cors
```

The data will be available at `http://localhost:3000` over CORS, with no path prefix. For example, device data will be at `http://localhost:3000/devices.json`.


### Deploying to Staging (18F specific)
Pushes to the 18f-pages branch are reflected in the staging environment https://pages.18f.gov/analytics.usa.gov/. All changes can be seen here prior to production release.

### Deploying the app to production

In production, the site's base URL is set to `https://analytics.usa.gov` and the data's base URL is set to `https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live`.

To deploy this app to `analytics.usa.gov`, you will need authorized access to 18F's Amazon S3 bucket for the project.

To deploy the site using `s3cmd`, production settings, and a **5 minute cache time**, run:

```bash
make deploy
```

**Use the full command above.** The full command ensures that the build completes successfully, with production settings, _before_ triggering an upload to the production bucket.
