## Rotating Deployer Credentials

After a number of months, [the cloud.gov space deployer](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account/) account's credentials will expire. This causes regular builds on CI to start failing. To rotate the credentials, follow the following series of steps:

First, delete the old credentials. To begin, find the name of the service key:

```shell
cf service-keys analytics-deployer-account
```

Once you have the name, you can delete it:

```shell
cf delete-service-key analytics-deployer-account <service key name>
```

Once the old one is deleted, create a new one:

```shell
cf create-service-key analytics-deployer-account analytics-deployer-key
```

Now, get the credentials for the new service by running the following:

```shell
cf service-key analytics-deployer-account analytics-deployer-key
```

This should give you a username and password. The username and password will be used to update the environment variables in CI. This needs to be done in the following places:

- [analytics.usa.gov CircleCI settings](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/analytics.usa.gov/edit#env-vars)
- [analytics-reporter CircleCI settings](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/analytics-reporter/edit#env-vars)
- [analytics-reporter-api CircleCI settings](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/analytics-reporter-api/edit#env-vars)
- [analytics-restarter CircleCI settings](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/analytics-restarter/edit#env-vars)

In the settings, the old `CF_USERNAME` and `CF_PASSWORD` values will need to be deleted and re-added with the new username and password values.
